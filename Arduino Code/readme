# Code Descriptions
task1_version2 was the code used in the final test. There was only one version of task3 created by me but there was another version of task3 created by another.
We ended up using both task3 codes to see which was faster at completing the task.
task2 was the simplest code by just modifying the Motor_ConTest to move the vehicle upwards and adding external weights.
The rest of the code was used to calibrate and test other subsystems of the vehicle.
